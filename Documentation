Documentation for Orbital Project: Wut 2 Do?

Database:
'get_mrt' folder contains code that generates all the latitude and longitude of all the MRT stations in Singapore. This is used by 'main\output' to generate the search results. Since only up to 60 results can be generated in 1 setting, by limiting each search to the latitude and longitude of all MRT stations, we are likely to generate < 60 results per setting, thus being able to get a more complete search and database.
'text_files' folder contains various text files that are required by 'main\output', for e.g, 'latlong.txt' is generated by 'get_mrt' to be used to generate search results. 
'database_main' contains 2 major subfolders. 'generate' uses Google API to generate the search results of the various categories, and places them into the database. 'output' receives the input from the app and returns the right output accordingly.

Major Decisions:
The format of this portion of the document will be as follow:

Decision:
Rationale:

UI
Remove back button
https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/temporal.html 
The above link states that “All Android devices provide a Back button for this type of navigation, so your app should not add a Back button to the UI”. Thus the decision to remove back button.

Database 
Migrated from freesqldatabase.com to 000webhost.com
000webhost.com allows for domain hosting and uploading of .php files. This allows the Android app to retrieve data from database.

Generating database
Using Text Search API instead of Radar Search
Radar Search, though it can generate up to 200 results (compared to Text Search, which can generate only up to 60 results), but the results generated can be quite inaccurate. As such, the plan now is to use Text Search API and loop through all the MRT stations in Singapore, so that it is less likely to hit the maximum of 60 results.
