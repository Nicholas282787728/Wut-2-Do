Database:
Algorithm for storing data into database:
  Create a String[] of categories. (undone)
  Store all these categories into "category" and give them their id. This will generate the "category" table. (undone)
  By using Radar Search/Text Search (Google Places API), pass in the "categories" String[] to generate in rows: "category, shop name, shop address" of the locations. (refer to place_search.php)
  Output the shop names and shop addresses into a .txt file. (create a new php file. add into functions)?
  By looping through the category name and shop name, use SQL to generate the category id from the category name. Then input both the category id and shop name. This will generate the "located_at" table. (create function to read the category and generate id).
  Use Java API such as Pattern and Matcher to split the address up into the respective fields (unit_no, building_name, building_address, postal_code) and output it into .txt (refer to Converter.java) else, can also immediately put it into an ArrayList and transfer to database.
  From the .txt file, use SQL and PHP to transfer the data into database.

Decision:
Rationale:

UI
Remove back button
https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/temporal.html 
The above link states that “All Android devices provide a Back button for this type of navigation, so your app should not add a Back button to the UI”. Thus the decision to remove back button.

Database 
Migrated from freesqldatabase.com to 000webhost.com
000webhost.com allows for domain hosting and uploading of .php files. This allows the Android app to retrieve data from database.
