Documentation for Orbital Project: Wut 2 Do?

Database:
'get_mrt' folder contains code that generates all the latitude and longitude of all the MRT stations in Singapore. This is used by 'main\output' to generate the search results. Since only up to 60 results can be generated in 1 setting, by limiting each search to the latitude and longitude of all MRT stations, we are likely to generate < 60 results per setting, thus being able to get a more complete search and database.
'text_files' folder contains various text files that are required by 'main\output', for e.g, 'latlong.txt' is generated by 'get_mrt' to be used to generate search results. 
'database_main' contains 2 major subfolders. 'generate' uses Google API to generate the search results of the various categories, and places them into the database. 'output' receives the input from the app and returns the right output accordingly.

Major Decisions:
The format of this portion of the document will be as follow:

Decision:
Rationale:

UI
Remove back button
https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/temporal.html 
The above link states that “All Android devices provide a Back button for this type of navigation, so your app should not add a Back button to the UI”. Thus the decision to remove back button.

Database 
Migrated from freesqldatabase.com to 000webhost.com
000webhost.com allows for database hosting and uploading of .php files, unlike freesqldatabase.com which only allows for database hosting. This allows the Android app to retrieve data from database.

Database
Using Text Search API instead of Radar Search
Radar Search, though it can generate up to 200 results (compared to Text Search, which can generate only up to 60 results, which may therefore result in some locations being missed out if the max of 60 results is reached), but the results generated can be quite inaccurate. As such, the plan now is to use Text Search API and loop through all the MRT stations in Singapore, so that it is less likely to hit the maximum of 60 results.

Database
'Search' only supports town locations i.e 'Pasir Ris' etc
Though the initial plan is to support search for building locations (such as Jurong Point etc), however many locations are not located in a particular building but just in a particular street (e.g Geylang Lorong 11 etc). Also, the address generated by Google API may not return the building name (e.g, the address of Jurong Point returns "1 Jurong West Central 2, 648886". "Jurong Point" is not found in the address), as such we may scrap the idea of supporting search for building names.
Database
Includes latitude & longitude in the table 'building'.
To facilitate generating the distance between user and the locations in the app. Initial decision was to generate everything on the app after the user has selected the category. However we realised that this is less efficient.

Linking between Android and PHP database
When switching activity, the keyword will be passed along to the next page and be appended to a PHP URL so that the required information can be downloaded i.e GET method.
GET method is chosen over the POST method as the data sent over to the database is not required to be secure.
