## Overview
Sometimes during a meet up with a group of friends, we may have trouble finding activities to do. This is where our app Wut 2 Do comes in. It enables users to find entertainment near them based on their current location.

## Features
(Main functions) Search for entertainment near you by:
1. Browsing through the available categories in the application.
1. Searching for specific activities that you are interested in.
1. Search for the building or town name, in which all the entertainment in the building or the town will be listed down.
1. Random suggestion, which will be further refined to be more relevant to the userâ€™s interests based on user's past search history as the user continue to use the application. 

(Additional functions) 
1. Allow users to create accounts and have their past searches saved.
1. Allow users add in their own reviews of the locations they have been to.
