Note that I''m one of those that doesn''t check bank statements regularly. By the time I checked, I realized that Fitness First was debiting my bank account on-goingly.

And besides, what''s the point of having a four month membership, 6-month membership, or 1-year? They said I signed the papers at the time and agreed. Here I sincerely warn you fellow members, beware of the small prints. I do remember that I was signing pages and pages of small prints that I felt not even a mortgage investment would require that many signatures.

Even knowing this, I was tricked. 3 month membership deal (I was working there for 3 months) seemed pretty ideal. \n\nTheir first gotcha is a classic: ''auto renewal.'' People signing up for a ''3 month membership'' suddenly find they''ve been auto charged for additional months. I didn''t fall for this one.\n\nPiling onto the first one is the lengths they make you go to cancel. No,  you can''t just hop online or give them a call. You need to get to the center in person and sign documents confirming your cancellation (search for nightmare stories of people who have moved). I was prepared for this as well.\n\nYet another potential ''gotcha'' they have is that you need to give a full month notice before cancellation, or you''re charged an entire extra month. That means if you tell them on March 2nd that you want out, you''ll be charged not only for the remainder of March, but the entire month of April as well because April 1st is less than a month away. Not going to get me here either.\n\nI knew of these tricks and confidently informed them over a month ahead of time that I would be cancelling at the 3 month mark. How did they get me? Apparently the ''3 months'' are 3 calendar months (definitely never stated, not in the contract). So though I signed up on January 10th and paid for the remainder of that month, my 3 months didn''t start until February. Ultimately, they forced me to pay for all of April even though 3 months ended in early April.\n\nWas the money a huge deal? No. But it wasn''t exactly cheap and being swindled just doesn''t feel good. Add to this the actual gym experience was crap. Had 2 guest passes with my membership. Brought a guest and was told she couldn''t enter because I hadn''t called ahead to inform them of the guest. Nowhere on the guest pass does it say this. It says it on page 14 of the giant contract.\n\nBottom line, these places know members come and go, so they will tr'),

Because less people come here, the water is relatively cleaner with none of the disgusting debris mucking about (like those yucky mucous strands that space out throughout the 50m like obstacles one needs to avoid unless you have swallowed it together with the pool water by accident).\n\nI come here whenever I can to get the sports endorphin high (I call it the happy hormone) to ease my loneliness as well as soak up as much vitamin D as my skin can handle. That is the thing about being in a long distance relationship with him back then. You get lonely pretty often.\n\nAnd in these times, it seems the world has conspired together to remind you how lonely you are. The in-you-face public displays of (diabetic inducing) affection, the colder than usual breeze as you walk towards home half-wishing for his hand to wrap around my shoulder and pull me tighter towards his warm body, the half empty bed as I slipped underneath my duvet looking for his hands I could hold onto in vain.\n\nWhen I plunge into the pool loneliness somehow leaves my heart as if afraid it will drown. The periodic breathing in and out as I focus on getting the maximum distance with each freestyle stroke allows me to focus on the happy times when we were together. I let off a little silly grin. I remembered the driving trip we did together in the UK a few years back. That is a tale for another time.\n\nThe T at the end of the pool bubble into view as I get ready to curl up my lip and initiate the flipturn. This is something I am proud of. The differentiating mark of a serious swimmer versus the casual. I love how the water rushes pass me as I push off the wall. And then a small dolphin kick to break the surface.

They don''t check your bags at the entrance unless you are carrying a fully loaded backpack.\n\nGo ahead. Grab your tickets and enjoy your visit.'),

Btw the student pass is only for kids ðŸ˜‚ If ur thinking of seeing shows u have to watch the waterworks show and the donkey comedy show \nYou''ll have the time of ur life u will never forget what crazy rides u went on and even crazy characters ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰'),
(944, 'Fred Pablo', '2016-08-06', 5, 'We visited both USS (common acronym for Universal Studios Singapore) and Legoland (in Johor Bahru or JB in MY). We have two kids in tow and the place was close, if not, part of Resorts World Sentosa. We had no clear expectations but to go there and possible enjoy the place. Took a grab car from our hotel to the place (which i recommend versus regular transit). Our grab car driver mentioned that it might not be busy because we were there on a Wednesday but little did we know that not busy means that we only had to wait 45-75 minutes in any line up. With that said, i would recommend to purchase express passes (around 30 or 50 bucks depending if it is just one time out of a list of rides or unlimited rides on participating rides). This will definitely ensure that you ride all the rides that you want. Imagine waiting 30 minutes per ride and there are about 20 rides/attractions you want to go into; that''s 10H! It might not be 20 rides/attractions but the list is around 17 or so. There is also a chance that they will close down outdoor rides if there are storm or thunder clouds coming, so imagine waiting in line for 45minutes and then when its your turn, they close it down. It has happened to us but we were on the express line which we only waited 5 minutes.\n\nI would recommend to eat just outside compounds of USS so you have a little bit more variety, heck, there is even a mcdonalds if you are craving for one (down the escalator to the taxi/bus area).\n\nThere are plenty of chairs/tables/areas with shade or air-conditioning as SG is a hot and humid place so don''t forget to bring your own water in a bottle but there are plenty of water fountains if you like hot water :).\n\nI chose not to provide any ride details as i would rather have you the reader to have little expectation and just enjoy the place.'),

What costs money is the individual attractions, such as entrance to the domes or specialty exhibits.\n\nThis is a great place to ride your bike or to walk around and catch digital monsters during both night and day, but if you come during the day you can see more of the parks beauty and even rent a scooter or unicycle to explore at a more windy pace.'),

It is not like a traditional botanic garden (go to the Botanic Gardens for that, very good). The site is huge, with plenty of things to see for all sorts of garden and walk lovers. The showstopping centre piece has to be the Supertree Grove (large tree like structures filled with vegetation and lights that come on at night as part of a show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm) but equally attractive are the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes.\n\nThe latter are both chargeable where as the rest of the grounds are free. You can spend all day wondering in this place, sitting, relaxing, taking in the sights and sounds, people watching and you''ll completely forget where you are. \n\nEvents are held on a regular basis and there are a good number of places to eat from the upscale Pollen restaurant (Singapore branch of the British establishment) to simple McDonald''s, right through to the enjoyable Satay by the Bay hawker center.\n\nYou can not say you have visited Singapore without visiting Gardens by the Bay.

We didn''t make use of the kitchen, but it had everything you could need for preparing meals and dining.  Bed was big and comfortable and nice and quiet.  Bathroom was also spacious and well equipped.\n\nLocation is excellent.  Really close transport, loads of great restaurants and sites of interest (mosque, little India, Bugis shopping centre) and easy to walk to the Marina or other central places if you wanted to.  There also a 7-11 in the same complex for odds and sods if you need them.\n\nThe rooftop swimming pool (and views from there) are amazing, especially at night.\n\nAll the staff we met were helpful and friendly.  Check in is not until 3pm, but if you arrive earlier they will hold your luggage for you.\n\nWifi in the room was OK, but only suitable for browsing and was often quite slow.  I had a Singapore SIM card and we ended up using that way more as it was quicker and more reliable.  Also had internet via Ethernet cable in room which was very good.  \n\nThe room we had provided an OK view (overlooking the Mosque area).  I suspect more expensive rooms facing towards the Marina had much better views.\n\nMain downsides were:\n- Breakfast, which was satisfactory, but choice was limited (toast, cereals, eggs, juices, croissants) and finding a table could be a struggle at busy times.  \n- Noisy drainage in the bathroom.  Every time you ran the tap in the sink, there was a loud noise from the drain.\n- Noisy extractor fan in bathroom.  Not a massive issue, but mildly irritating.\n- Occasional noise from mosque across the road when calling to prayer at 5am, which woke my girlfriend up a couple of days (she is a light sleeper). \n\nIt was quite pricey, but if you want to feel like having your home away from home I recommend here over a hotel.'),

For me, they are the most glorious of all creations.\nSo it should not come as a surprise that I will be gushing about this place throughout the review.\n\nLocation:\nReaching Jurong Bird park is not difficult. However, being located on the outskirts of the city, it requires at least 1.5 hours to reach if you are using MRT and bus service. Simply follow the instructions on the website on how to reach there and you will be fine.\n\nTickets:\nWe purchased the park hopper package, which included entry for Jurong Bird Park, River Cruise, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, which costed us SGD62. I will strongly urge everyone to do the same, as this package is discounted compared to individual tickets (even if you plan on going to two locations, it still works out cheaper)\n\nZoo Premises:\nZoo itself is vast and large, with a tropical setting. It gets hot and humid during afternoons. Wear light clothes. To go around, you can either walk, or use the tram services, which cost around SGD10 for 2 people. Once you enter, a bunch of noisy parrots greets you, raising all sorts of hell, chattering really loud. For me, their noises were pure music. They sit on a perch with trainers and visitors are encouraged to take pictures with them. You can''t have one on your shoulder or anything, but you can hold a branch on which several of these birds are perched. You will also have those red plumed macaws around, but you can''t interact with them because they are not used to different people touching them. Once you take the pictures, you can buy them from nearby kiosk at an exorbitant price. That was real money gouging tactic employed by the management of all the zoos in Singapore. We gave it a pass.\nThere are several enclosures housing amazing exotic birds. My favorite ones were Birds of Paradise and Parrot and macaws enclosures. The zookeepers seem to take great care of the birds and have great love and respect for them.\nZoo also has one of the largest Aviaries in'),
